### What I learned from this project

For my first ever github project, I felt that I have strengthened my understanding of various concepts. These include:

1. Working with the pandas, sqlite3, and sqlitedict modules. As a result, I got the opportunity to store, maintain, manipulate, and access databases 
2. Creating classes, instances, functions, data structures, and algorithms, to resolve a variety of problems that required creative and critical thinking
3. Applying the various pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, to increase readability and organization
4. Comprehending the basics of Github, which includes creating a repository, new branches, and commits 
5. Employing nextcord API and asynchronous methods  

### What I can improve on 

Despite my upcomings, I understand that there are many things that I can improve on. These include:

1. Organization of the project. In the future, organizing files into certain folders, or creating a roadmap for me to follow, rather than implementing functions on the fly
2. Code Readability. I want to maintain consistent naming throughout the ENTIRE project, and would also like to add descriptions to allow readers other than myself to understand functions and such without too much analysis
3. Time complexity and space complexity. Although not as essential in this project, in the future, I would like to concern myself with being as efficient as possible with memory allocation and execution time. I'm thinking of basing my next project off of C++, because 1) I would like to learn it and 2) It would sort of force me to pay attention to time and space complexity
4. Visualization and Presentation. Using the nextcord API was a huge help, as it allowed me to quickly develop without having to worry about creating the environment the game would be played on. However, I would like to make my future projects more satisfying to use
