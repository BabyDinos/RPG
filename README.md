# Trade and Adventure (TAA)

## What is TAA?

TAA is a text-based RPG that includes adventuring and encountering monsters to defeat, using a rock-paper-scissor-like combat system. This game consists of a leveling, looting, loot box, and market system. Currently, it has three bosses you may challenge, two classes to choose from, and many pieces of equipment and pets to collect.

### What I learned from this project

For my first ever GitHub project, I felt I had strengthened my understanding of various concepts. These include:

1. Working with the pandas, sqlite3, and sqlitedict modules. As a result, I got the opportunity to store, maintain, manipulate, and access databases 
2. Creating classes, instances, functions, data structures, and algorithms to resolve a variety of problems that required creative and critical thinking
3. Applying the various pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, to increase the readability and organization of my code
4. Comprehending the basics of Github, which includes creating a repository, new branches, and commits 
5. Employing nextcord API and asynchronous methods  

### What I can improve on 

Despite my upcoming, I understand that there are many things that I can improve on. These include:

1. Organization of the project. In the future, organize files into specific folders, or create a roadmap for me to follow rather than implementing functions on the fly
2. Code Readability. I want to maintain consistent naming throughout the *entire* project, and I would also like to add descriptions to allow readers other than myself to understand functions and such without too much analysis
3. Time complexity and space complexity. Although not as essential in this project, in the future, I would like to concern myself with being as efficient as possible with memory allocation and execution time. I'm thinking of basing my next project on C++ because 1) I would like to learn it, and 2) It would force me to pay attention to time and space complexity
4. Visualization and Presentation. Using the nextcord API was a huge help, as it allowed me to develop quickly without worrying about creating the environment where players would play the game. However, I would like to make my future projects more satisfying to use
